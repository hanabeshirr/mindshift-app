# mindshift-app: AI-Powered Mental Health Support
MindShift is a student-focused mental health app developed during the UAE InnovAIte Hackathon 2025. Built in under 48 hours using OpenAI’s language models, the app provides personalized emotional support and calming strategies for users navigating academic and personal stress.

## 🧠 Purpose

Designed by a team of high school students competing against university-level developers, MindShift aims to make mental health guidance accessible, responsive, and empathetic — especially for young people managing exam stress, burnout, and emotional overwhelm.

## 🛠️ Built With

- **OpenAI GPT** – Natural language understanding for adaptive, conversational support  
- **Flutter & Dart** – Cross-platform mobile app development  
- **Google Sheets** – Initial data tracking and analysis  
- **Figma** – UI/UX prototyping and layout testing  

## 🏆 Hackathon Achievement

MindShift earned an **Honorable Mention** at the UAE InnovAIte Hackathon 2025 for its innovation, potential impact, and technical execution under pressure. The app was fully functional during the hackathon and provided real-time support based on user-reported emotional states.

## 🚧 Current Status

After the hackathon, I continued developing MindShift independently, refining its design and exploring advanced features like emotion classification. Due to API access costs, the project is currently paused, but the experience deepened my understanding of rapid prototyping, ethical AI, and user-centered product design.

## ✨ What I Learned

- How to lead a tech project from concept to prototype under extreme time constraints  
- The challenges of deploying AI responsibly, especially in sensitive domains like mental health  
- How to balance technical ambition with practical limitations (e.g., API usage and cost)  
- The importance of building with empathy and real user needs in mind

## 🌍 Future Vision

Though MindShift is paused, the mission continues: building AI tools that serve human well-being. I plan to pursue further studies and projects at the intersection of **technology, empathy, and accessibility**, where I can explore how intelligent systems can support — not replace — human connection.
